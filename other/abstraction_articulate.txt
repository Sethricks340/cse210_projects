Prove: Articulate- Abstraction

CSE 210

Abstraction is the principle of taking a concept that is complex and labeling it in such a way that allows usage of said concept without having to 
know all of the implications that are taking place "under the hood." A benefit of abstraction is being able to utilize something that has been written
without having to go through and understand every single line of code that is running in the background. For example, in the method ".WriteLine()"
there are literally thousands of lines of code that make it possible for a message to be printed to the screen. But for a programmer to use this, 
it is only necessary to know the valid syntax in calling it. This could be applied to any program that someone might create, in that it can be used 
without the user having to think about every little thing that is going on. I used the principle of abstraction when I wrote my journal program, in that 
I created different classes that perfomed different functions. I then can call different aspects of this class, without having to rewrite or really 
even think about what is occuring. In general, the principle of abstraction is very useful in the simplification and streamline of complex and difficult
programs.
