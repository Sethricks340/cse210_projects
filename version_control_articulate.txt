What is version control and why is it important? 

Version control is a process by which source code is managed on 
different levels simutaneously. It allows software developers to access,
edit, and upload code- all while their edit history is recorded and commented 
on. If a mistake is made, developers can identify when, where, and by whom 
it was made. The code can then be reverted back into a past version, and hence 
the bug is omitted. With version control, teams of developers are also enabled to see 
what the current state of the code is, instead of having to guess who has the most 
updated version.

An example of a version control system is git. Using the terminal, a developer can
stage, commit, and push their version of the source file back into a repository, 
where otherdevelopers can see it. 

Here is an example of how this could be done in a terminal:

//This command adds the current file to the staging area, 
//where it is ready to be committed.
git add .

//This command saves the current changes of the line, and allows a comment on the changes.
git commit -m "I've fixed the bug on line 38."

//This command uploads the file to github, where it is stored in a remote repository. 
//If this repository is public, it can be viewed by other developers.
git push
